Powershell script with GUI to easily run commands on a remote workstation

The original basically works, but there are a lot of things I wanted to fix and do better. Then I realized that Winforms don't work on new versions of Powershell, so I began rewriting it in WPF, though I have yet to add all the functionality of the first into it.
